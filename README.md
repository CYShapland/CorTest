# CorTest
Simulation code and package for manuscript "Use of genetic correlations to examine selection bias"

## Description

Within the manuscript, for one sample test we have used package `psych` for Steiger and Bartlett's test. However there was an error in Jennrich, we have modified it in `cortest_jenn.R`. 

We have also included a function of how we have simulated data.
