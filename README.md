# CorTest

Simulation code and R package used for manuscript "Use of genetic correlations to examine selection bias" (see citation below).

## Description

Within the manuscript, for one sample test we have used package `psych` for Steiger and Bartlett's test. However there was an error in Jennrich, we have modified it in `cortest_jenn.R`.

Folder `Simulation code` provides R code for simulated data of each scenarios within our manuscript and supplementary materials.
